1. Explain the difference between Relational Databases and SQL.
Relational databases adhere to a certain structure where information is organized into tables and are linked to other tables with relationships. SQL is the standard query language that interfaces and modifies data in Relational databases.

2. Why do tables need a primary key?
Each entry in the database needs a primary key as a unique identifier so it’s accessible for queries or references for other foreign key relationships.

3. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
Foreign key

4. What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.
An additional table that has relationships formed with columns/fields from both tables. The foreign keys do not have to be primary keys.
